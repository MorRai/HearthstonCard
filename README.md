# HearthstonCard
An application for viewing Heartstones cards by class with filters. The data is taken from api.blizzard.com, if access to the application fails, the authentication key is updated. Before the data is received from the Internet, the data from the cache of the implemented room is displayed.
Also there is a part in which I studied working with Goggle Maps for android. To separate them, I used BottomNavigation.

## Libraries and other stuff applied:
- Room
- Retrofit
- Coroutines
- MVVM
- Koin 
- Clean Architecture
- Google map, location
